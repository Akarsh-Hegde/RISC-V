## Introduction to Risc-v Basic Keywords
- **Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)**
  - An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) refers to the set of instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can understand and execute. It defines the interface between software and hardware, specifying the operations that a CPU can perform, the data types it can manipulate, and the memory addressing modes it supports.

- **Risc-V ISA**
  - Risc-V ISA is an open-source ISA that has simpler and fixed length instructions that allows us to create custom processors for specific needs without being tied to proprietary architectures
 
- **Tools Used for the flow**
  - As we are aware of the flow, we will be using Risc-v ISA ALP and the RTL used will be picorv32a (We will be using rv64i during initial stages)

# Goal : Any High level Program that is written should be able to get executed in our CHIP

### List of well-known extensions present in Risc-V ISA

``` rv32i``` ``` rv64i``` ```rv32imc``` ```rv64imc``` ```rv32imafdc``` ```rv64imafdc``` ```rv32imcb``` ```rv64imcb``` ```rv32imc_sv32``` ```rv64gcv```

### Extensions and their Applications

- **I (Integer)** :The I set includes the base integer instruction set for RISC-V. It provides fundamental integer arithmetic and logical operations, data movement, and control flow instructions.
  - ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, ADDI, SLTI, JAL, BEQ, LW

- **M (Multiply and Divide)** : The M set adds integer multiplication and division instructions to the base integer set. These instructions are particularly useful for arithmetic-heavy computations.
  - MUL, MULH, DIV, REM
  
- **A (Atomic)** : The A set introduces atomic memory access instructions. These instructions enable multiple operations on memory locations to be performed atomically, ensuring that other processors or threads cannot observe intermediate states.
  - LR (Load-Reserved), SC (Store-Conditional), AMO (Atomic Memory Operation)
  
- **F (Single-Precision Floating-Point)**: The F set adds single-precision floating-point instructions. These instructions enable arithmetic operations on 32-bit floating-point numbers.
  - FADD.S, FSUB.S, FMUL.S, FDIV.S, FCVT.W.S, FCVT.S.W

- **D (Double-Precision Floating-Point)** : The D set includes double-precision floating-point instructions. These instructions allow arithmetic operations on 64-bit floating-point numbers.
  - FADD.D, FSUB.D, FMUL.D, FDIV.D, FCVT.W.D, FCVT.D.W

- **C (Compressed)** : The C set introduces a compressed instruction format that reduces the size of code. Compressed instructions maintain the same functionality as their non-compressed counterparts but use shorter encodings.
  - C.ADDI4SPN, C.LWSP, C.ADDI, C.SW, C.JALR, C.BEQZ

- **G (Atomic and Lock-Free Operations)** : The G set, also known as the "GAS Set," is an alternative to the A set. It focuses on providing atomic and lock-free instructions to simplify hardware implementation.
  - LRV (Load-Reserved Variant), SCV (Store-Conditional Variant), AMO (Atomic Memory Operation Variants)

- **V (Vector)** :The V set adds vector instructions to the ISA, enabling Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations. These instructions allow efficient parallel processing of data elements in vectors.
  - VADD, VMUL, VFMADD, VLW, VSW

- **S (Supervisor)** : The S set, often used in privileged modes, includes instructions for managing and interacting with the supervisor-level operations of the system, such as handling exceptions and interrupts.
  - ECALL, EBREAK, SRET, MRET, WFI

- **B (Bit Manipulation)** : The B set introduces instructions for bit manipulation operations, allowing efficient manipulation of individual bits in registers and memory.
  - ANDI, ORI, XORI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI

## BASICS :

Instructions that act on signed or unsigned integers are called Base Integer Instructions
There are 47 Base Integer Instructions present in RISC-V ISA

### Types of Instruction based on encoding format

1. **R-Type (Register-Type):**
   - These instructions operate on registers and have a fixed format for their operands.
   - Examples: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT, SLTU

2. **I-Type (Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have an immediate operand and one register operand.
   - Examples: ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI, LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, JALR

3. **S-Type (Store-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for storing values from registers to memory.
   - Examples: SB, SH, SW

4. **B-Type (Branch-Type):**
   - These instructions perform conditional branching based on comparisons.
   - Examples: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU

5. **U-Type (Upper Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have a larger immediate field for encoding larger constants.
   - Examples: LUI, AUIPC

6. **J-Type (Jump-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for unconditional jumps and function calls.
   - Examples: JAL

**[number]** represents number of bits occupied by that field

1. **Opcode [7] :** The opcode is a field within a machine language instruction that indicates the operation to be performed by the instruction. It defines the type of operation, such as arithmetic, logic, memory access, or control flow. Opcodes are used by the CPU to determine how to execute the instruction.

2. **rd (Destination Register) [5]:** The "rd" field represents the destination register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register where the result of the operation will be stored. After executing the instruction, the computed value will be placed in this register.

3. **rs1 (Source Register 1) [5]:** The "rs1" field represents the first source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve two operands, "rs1" typically corresponds to the first operand.

4. **rs2 (Source Register 2) [5]:** The "rs2" field represents the second source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve three operands, "rs2" typically corresponds to the second operand.

5. **func7 and func3 (Function Fields)[7] [3]:** These fields further refine the operation specified by the opcode. The "func7" field is used to distinguish different variations of instructions within the same opcode category. The "func3" field is used to specify a more specific operation within the opcode category. Together, these fields allow for a finer level of instruction differentiation.

6. **imm (Immediate Value):** The "imm" field represents an immediate value that is part of the instruction. Immediate values are constants that are embedded within the instruction itself. They can be used for various purposes, such as specifying offsets, constants, or small data values directly within the instruction.
7. 
#### ABI : Application Binary Interface

The instructions generated by compiler using a target ISA can be accessed by OS and User directly
- The parts of ISA accessible to User : User ISA
- The parts of ISA accessible to OS : system ISA
The access is done using Sysytem calls with the help of ABI

==> If we want to access hardware resources of processor, it has to be done via registers using ABI(names)

### ABI Names : 
- ABI names for registers serve as a standardized way to designate the purpose and usage of specific registers within a software ecosystem. These names play a critical role in maintaining compatibility, optimizing code generation, and facilitating communication between different software components.

<img width="1000" height="600" src="https://github.com/yagnavivek/PES_ASIC_CLASS/assets/93475824/27d13974-1b70-4207-a2fb-05b232027323">

#### Data can be stored in register by 2 methods
1. Directly store in registers
2. Store into registers from memory

To store 64 bits of data from mem to reg, we use 8*8bit stores ie., m[0],m[1]......m[7]. 

- ___RISC-V uses Little Endian format to store the data ie., Least significant Byte is stored in m[0]___

## Simulate a C program using ABI function call (using registers) and execute 

The required program files are under day 2 folder
![PIC 1](https://github.com/Akarsh-Hegde/pes_asic_class/assets/79705687/fa0fa76c-457b-493c-bb94-f21364ef15ff)

Here we can observe that at 5th line, inorder to comute the result ,its going to the "load"  function

### Further we will see how to run a C program on on RISC-V CPU

![image](https://github.com/Pavan2280/RISC-V/assets/131603225/1695d5f6-eab9-4279-9419-b2817800b002)

## Overview
This RISC-V Architecture Block Diagram illustrates the fundamental components and their interactions within a computer system based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture. RISC-V is a modular and customizable architecture, providing a versatile framework for designing processors tailored to specific application requirements.

## Components
1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
   - *Description*: The CPU serves as the core of the RISC-V processor, responsible for executing instructions. It includes multiple stages:
     - Instruction Fetch (IF): Fetches instructions from memory.
     - Instruction Decode (ID): Decodes the fetched instructions.
     - Execution (EX): Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
     - Memory (MEM): Manages data memory access.
     - Write Back (WB): Writes results back to registers.

2. **Instruction Memory**
   - *Description*: This memory component stores the program's instructions that the CPU fetches and executes. It's essential for the program's proper execution.

3. **Data Memory**
   - *Description*: Data Memory stores data used by the CPU during program execution. It is crucial for data manipulation and storage.

4. **Registers**
   - *Description*: Registers are a set of general-purpose storage units used for temporary data storage and manipulation by the CPU. They play a pivotal role in instruction execution.

5. **Control Unit**
   - *Description*: The Control Unit manages control signals and coordinates the activities of the CPU's components, ensuring the proper execution of instructions.

6. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**
   - *Description*: The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations as directed by the CPU's instructions. It is the computational workhorse of the processor.

7. **Instruction Decoder**
   - *Description*: The Instruction Decoder interprets and decodes instructions fetched from memory. It translates instructions into actions for the CPU to execute.

8. **Cache Memory**
   - *Description*: Cache Memory provides fast access to frequently used instructions and data. It helps improve the system's overall performance by reducing memory access times.

9. **Bus Interface**
   - *Description*: The Bus Interface facilitates data transfer between the CPU, memory, and peripherals. It ensures efficient communication within the system.

10. **Peripherals**
    - *Description*: Peripherals are external devices such as input/output controllers, timers, and more. They connect to the CPU, enhancing the system's functionality by allowing interaction with the outside world.
